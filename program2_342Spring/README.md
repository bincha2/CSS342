Greedy Robot is a recursive program that based on 5 inputs ( starting x & y, treasure x & y, and # of units the robot can move), will find the most optimal paths/solutions.
Similar to recursive Queens project, no path can be duplicated, and instead finds the number of unique optimal paths, and displays its findings on the log , alongside the actual path it self. 


Catalan Program simply uses recursion to find the Nth Catalan number based on the input.
